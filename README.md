# OrCAD_PCB_files_for_solar_inverter_project
OrCAD version 9.2 was used for generating these files.
These are the files generated from the OrCAD PCB designing software for my project on developing a solar inverter. 
The hardware testing for this PCB board was carried out by using the DSPIC33Fx microcontroller.
